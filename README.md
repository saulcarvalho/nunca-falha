### 👋 Hi, I’m <i>nunca-falha</i>
- 🏛️ I'm a final year student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Electronics and Computers.
- 📽️ My hobbies include watching Movies and TV Series. My favourite Movie and TV Series type always ends up being Mystical/Fantasy and/or Action. So it's no surprise that I'm a fan of big trilogies and sagas like The Lord of the Rigs, The Hobbit, Harry Potter, Star Wars, The Witcher, The Wheel of Time ... you get the point. <br>
Sometimes I also go running.
