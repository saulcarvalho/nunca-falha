<h2> 👋 Hi, I’m <i> nunca-falha </i> </h2>
<h3> Education </h3>
<p> 🏛️ I'm a final year student in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a major in Electronics and Computers. </p> <br>

<h3> Username origin </h3>
<p> The name nunca-falha originated from failing multiple times to create a username, so as a joke I tried to write nuncafalha / nunca-falha which translates to 'never fails'.         <br> I ended up sticking with it. </p>
